# Symbols-electrical-de
German electrical symbols for Sweet Home 3D

This is a fork of the symbols that can be found here:
* http://www.sweethome3d.com/blog/2017/12/08/additional_contributors_libraries.html
* https://sourceforge.net/p/sweethome3d/d-models/325/

**Changes from the original library**
* Symbols are now ca. 25 cm x 25 cm (in my case the original symbols had a size of 5m x 5m)
* Some small changes inside Create2DSymbols.sh
